Answer interview questions

### Q: What is a namespace?
A namespace is used to organize a collection of classes that are within the namespace. 
### Q: What are value types?
There are many different value types and they are variables that store values.
### Q: What are reference types?
Unlike value types, reference types do not hold the value in itself, but instead is a reference to a stored value. 
### Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
It is a way to make the program more simple. It is a property that is automatically (hence the name) built into the C# compiler.
### Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
Using statments are used to declare the namespace that will be used for the program.
### Q: What are dynamic type variables?
Dynamic types are assigned as a type of value and are compiled at runtime. 
### Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
It is used to check if an object is the correct type.
### Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
Generics allow the userf to use methods or interfaces as a parameter. They are used to make the performancfe of the program better by similifying. 
### Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
It allows a class to expose its member varaibles and functions to ot other functions and object.
### Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
Yes, to do so you would use "params" and this will allow the user to define a number of arguments in a list. 
### Q: How do you sort an array?
You would use ArrayName.Sort.
### Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
Nullable types allow the value to be set to a special value NULL and not just positive or negative values. 
### Q: What is an enumeration?
Enumeration allows the user to set specific values. It is a type of reference. 
### Q: What is inheritance?
It is the ability to create a class that receives attributes from an existing class.
### Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?
No, multiple inheritance is not supported. 
### Q: What is the purpose of as operator
It serves to set compatable value types as one another. 
### Q: What is an object?
An object holds any value, reference or dynamic type. 
### Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?
The difference between a struct and a class is that structs are value types are classes are referencwe types. 
### Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?
A break statment will end a loop, while a continue statment will allow it to run and go through steps over and over. 
### Q: What is this and how is it used?
It instantiate objects from a class that have the same traits.  
### Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?
Try and catch are used to handle exceptions. Try does this inside while catch sends an error message. 
### Q: How is exception handling done?
Exception handling is done with try and catch. 
### Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?
After trying and catching exceptions, finally will suggest what the program should do.
### Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
One difference between an Array and an ArrayList is that elements can be added or removed from an ArrayList at any point, whereas arrays have a fixed length that canâ€™t be altered during runtime.  Arrays can only store one datatype while Array Lists can store all the datatype values.  
### Q: What is an object?
An object can hold any value,reference, or dynamic type. 
### Q: Define constructor.
A constructor is a special method of the class that automatically calls a method when it is created.
### Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
When the program can completely write out a varaible and decied the type of value to assign it. 
### Q: What is an abstract class?
An abstract class is used to define a base class in a program.
### Q: What is an interface?
An interface tells the classes what to do. It contains only the declaration of the methods, properties, and events. 
### Q: What is a method?
A method is a group of statements that complete a task. 
### Q: What is a property?
A property provides a flexible tool to read and write the value in a private field. 
### Q: What is an access specifier?
An access specifier describes the scope of accessibility of an object. 
### Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
The 5 access speciferes are private, public, internal, protected and protected internal. 
### Q: What is a collection?
A collection stores variables that can be taken out or put into the collection/ 
### Q: What is a Hash Table?
A hash table is a class that represents a collection of key and value pairs.
